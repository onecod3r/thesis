# TODO — sign2speech

Living project TODO, organized by workstream so new tasks can be filed under an
existing section or a new one added without restructuring.

**Status legend:** `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[?]` open question / decision needed

**How to add a task:** file it under the matching workstream section below. If it
doesn't fit an existing one, add a new `## N. <Workstream Name>` section at the end
(before "Backlog / Someday") rather than bolting it onto an unrelated section.

## 0. Repo Restructure Follow-ups & Tooling

Cleanup left over from the move to the flat `src/` layout (notebooks renamed to
`<dataset>.<stage>.<topic>.ipynb`), plus the **2026-07-18 restructure** (§0.4:
unified `modules/model` training stack, flat epoch-seconds registry with
meta.json schema v2, `data/{raw,cache,temp,models}` placement policy,
docs daily/weekly/reports split).

### 0.1 Stale imports / references broken by the restructure

- [x] **`src/modules/data/` no longer exists on disk** (2026-07-16): `dataset.py`
  (`GISLRRawDataset`) and `landmark_worker.py` are gone. `landmark_worker.py` is
  superseded by `modules/dataset/landmark/extraction.py` (§2). **Resolved
  2026-07-16:** `GISLRRawDataset` no longer needs restoring — the rebuilt
  `gislr.1.model.gru.ipynb` defines its dataset in-notebook (in-RAM arrays,
  `num_workers=0`, the pattern proven by the ME-126 training script).
- [x] `src/gislr.1.model.gru.ipynb` imports `from modules.dataset import ...` —
  **resolved 2026-07-16** by the notebook overhaul (§3.1): it now imports only
  the subset registry (`modules.dataset.landmark.subsets`) and defines the
  dataset class itself.
- [ ] `src/popsign.1.mediapipe.ipynb` imports `from modules.datasets import DATASETS`
  and uses `DATASETS["ISLR"]` — `datasets/` was deleted; it's now
  `modules.paths.DATASETS` with key `"GISLR"`.
- [x] `src/modules/` has no `__init__.py` files — **resolved 2026-07-18**: every
  package level ships one (`modules/`, `modules/model/`, `modules/scripts/`,
  `modules/dataset/`, `modules/dataset/landmark/`).
- [ ] `src/popsign.1.mediapipe.ipynb` currently contains early **GISLR** motion-energy
  exploration code, not POPSIGN extraction — retire that content (superseded by
  `gislr.0.dataset.motion-energy.ipynb`) and rebuild the notebook as the extraction
  driver (§2).

### 0.2 Packaging / config

- [x] `pyproject.toml`: torch/torchvision/torchaudio sat under an invalid top-level
  `[dependencies]` table. **Fixed 2026-07-15:** `torch>=2.13.0` declared in
  `[project].dependencies` with the cu130 index pinned via `[tool.uv.sources]`;
  torchvision/torchaudio dropped (nothing imports them, and torchaudio has no
  cu130 build that resolves for the full `requires-python` range). `uv sync`
  verified: torch 2.13.0+cu130, CUDA available.
- [x] `pyproject.toml`: placeholder description replaced (2026-07-15).
- [ ] Type checker: `pyrefly.toml` was deleted but `pyrefly` is still a runtime
  dependency, and the dev group also pulls in `ty` — pick one, drop the other, and
  move it to the dev group.
- [ ] `.gitignore`: the bare `data/` pattern also ignores `src/data/external/`
  (the MediaPipe `holistic_landmarker.task`) and `src/data/cache/dataframes/`
  (POPSIGN manifests) — decide whether to narrow the ignore and commit those, or
  document them as download/generate-on-setup. (Still open after the 2026-07-15
  rewrite — the pattern was kept as-is pending this decision.)
- [x] `.gitignore`: rewritten 2026-07-15 for the `src/` layout — stale root-level
  `cache/*.npy` lines and the self-ignoring `.gitignore` line removed; now covers
  `src/cache/`, model weights (`src/models/**/*.pt`, bare `gru_best.pt` /
  `gru_latest.pt` from notebook runs), export artifacts (`*.onnx`, `*.tflite`,
  `src/saved_model_dir/`, `src/final_saved_model/`) and `.ipynb_checkpoints/`.
- [x] Repo size: `src/gislr.0.competition.entry.1st.ipynb` was 17 MB — 15 MB of
  landmark-animation cell outputs (cells 10–13) stripped 2026-07-15 → 247 KB.
  Code, markdown and the training-log output are intact. Full copy with outputs:
  `src/cache/gislr.0.competition.entry.1st.with-outputs.ipynb` (gitignored) or
  Kaggle discussion 406978.

### 0.3 Model-run metadata & queryable index (2026-07-17, superseded by §0.4's schema v2)

Structured run records so "best 3 gru runs on gislr" / "all runs on subset X"
is a query, not a folder crawl:

- [x] Per-run **`metadata.json`** schema (dataset, architecture, subset, coords,
  n_params, hyperparameters, train-loop vs canonical accuracies, `eval_status`
  pending/canonical) — backfilled for all 5 existing gislr/gru runs 2026-07-17.
- [x] **`scripts/build_model_index.py`** — flattens every run's `metadata.json`
  into `src/models/index.csv` (committed) and answers filter queries
  (`--dataset/--architecture/--subset/--top`); warns on runs missing metadata.
- [x] `gislr.1.model.gru.ipynb` §7 (run-docs cell) now also writes
  `metadata.json` (preserving canonical-eval fields on re-runs);
  `scripts/eval_gru.py` promotes `eval_status` to `canonical` after the
  per-class eval.
- [x] Run folders are always fresh (2026-07-17): `gislr.1.model.gru.ipynb`'s
  `resolve_run_dir` no longer reuses/skips a **completed** run — every new
  training gets a new `<timestamp>` folder (timestamp = training start), even
  under identical conditions. Auto-resume still continues an *interrupted*
  run in its own folder.
- [~] Future training notebooks must write the same `metadata.json` schema —
  **done for GISLR** (the lstm/bilstm/cnn1d siblings inherit the GRU
  notebook's §7 emission, 2026-07-17); still applies to future POPSIGN
  training notebooks.
- [x] ~~Rebuild `index.csv` after the canonical evals of the six pending runs~~ —
  **voided 2026-07-18**: those runs' weights were deleted with the old
  `src/models/` tree during the restructure, so their canonical evals can
  never run. Their train-loop numbers stand as historical references
  (git history ≤ `3668dae` + docs/daily/); the registry restarted empty (§0.4).

### 0.4 Restructure 2026-07-18 — unified stack, flat registry, data-tree policy

Executed 2026-07-18 (full write-up: `docs/daily/2026-07-18.md`):

- [x] **`src/modules/model/`** — unified training stack (`architectures.py`
  single model-class definition shared with eval, `data.py`, `registry.py`,
  `train.py`, `report.py`); the four `gislr.1.model.*.ipynb` notebooks
  regenerated as thin drivers (identity block + `modules.model` calls).
- [x] **Registry v2**: flat `src/data/models/<epoch-seconds>/` folders holding
  only `meta.json` + `best.pt`/`last.pt` (gitignored) + `assets/`;
  schema v2 documented in README.md § "meta.json schema" (machine check:
  `modules/model/registry.py::REQUIRED_KEYS`); `meta.json` rewritten every
  epoch by the driver; **registry reset to empty** (header-only `index.csv`).
- [x] **Single progress bar per training run** (batch progress, metrics, LR,
  plateau counter in one bar) — replaces the nested-bar + per-epoch-print spam.
- [x] **`modules/paths.py`**: absolute CWD-independent tree constants
  (`RAW/CACHE/TEMP/EXTERNAL/MODELS`), lazy dataset resolution (import no
  longer downloads), `cleanup_temp()`.
- [x] **Data placement policy** applied: POPSIGN pilot npz → `data/temp/popsign_pilot/`
  with cleanup cell (stale `data/raw/popsign/_pilot` deleted); diagnostic
  caches → `data/cache/gislr/{motion_analysis,subset_comparison}`;
  manifests → `data/cache/popsign/dataframes/`; `.gitignore` reworked
  (all of `src/data/` ignored except `data/models/` minus weights/exports).
- [x] **Scripts split**: project CLIs in `src/modules/scripts/` (`eval_gru.py`
  takes a run folder, `build_model_index.py` flat-layout; both run from any
  CWD); root `scripts/` = housekeeping only.
- [x] **Docs split**: `docs/daily/` + `docs/weekly/<YYYY>-<WW>.md` +
  `docs/reports/<topic>.md` (convention in `docs/README.md`).
- [ ] Regenerate the POPSIGN video manifests at
  `data/cache/popsign/dataframes/{train,test}.csv` — the pre-restructure
  copies were cleared with the old cache tree (blocks §2 pilot/bulk runs).
- [ ] First v2-regime training runs (user) to seed the fresh registry —
  re-establishes the FULL_543 baseline and ME_126 leader under the new
  schema before any new ablation conclusions.
- [ ] `popsign.2.model.ipynb` / `popsign.3.pipeline.ipynb` still predate the
  restructure (old paths, TF-era code) — modernize or retire alongside
  `popsign.1` (§0.1).

## 1. Landmark Motion-Over-Time Analysis (GISLR)

**Goal:** One robust, resumable notebook measuring how much each landmark moves
over time, at three scopes: per-video, per-category, global. Builds on existing
motion-energy pipeline findings (RMS speed, `["type","landmark_index"]` grouping,
Savitzky-Golay filtering) rather than re-deriving them.

**Location:** `src/gislr.0.dataset.motion-energy.ipynb`

**Status: ✅ executed end-to-end 2026-07-15 — all three scopes complete, 0 failed
units. Findings, stats, figures and the landmark keep/discard recommendation are
written up in `docs/2026-07-15.md`.** Remaining work moved to §1.8.

### 1.0 Decision to lock in

- [x] **Confirm DuckDB as the loading layer.** Adopted — `gislr.0` builds on
  `get_duckdb_conn()` querying parquet via `CREATE VIEW ... glob`, so aggregation
  happens before pulling into pandas and peak memory stays bounded by one query's
  result, not dataset size. Revisit only if a blocker turns up.

### 1.1 Reusable core (build once, use in all three scopes)

- [x] `get_duckdb_conn()` — validated end-to-end (94,477 videos · 250 signs · 21
  participants resolved from the meta view).
- [x] `load_landmarks_for_paths(paths: list[str]) -> pd.DataFrame` — validated; the
  one function all three scopes call (explicit parquet file list, not glob filter).
- [x] `compute_motion_energy(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame` — validated:
  Savitzky-Golay (window=7, polyorder=2) → RMS speed over raw-valid transitions
  only (NaN policy) → tidy long format incl. `n_valid_transitions`.
- [x] `plot_motion_gridspec(df, title)` — validated across all three scopes
  (auto-detects per-video vs aggregate frames, std as error bars).
- [x] Run the reusable-core cells against real data — done, all scopes ran clean.

### 1.2 Resumable caching / state management

- [x] Manifest per scope: `cache/motion_analysis/<scope>_manifest.json` — with
  atomic saves (temp file + `os.replace`).
- [x] Idempotent write pattern: per-unit parquet written **before** marking `done`
  in the manifest — validated over 50 + 10 + 189 units, 0 failures.
- [x] Resume check (skip `done`, retry `failed`) + per-unit try/except — validated
  by the executed runs (skip path exercised on re-runs; a deliberate
  mid-run-interrupt drill wasn't needed given the invariants held over 249 units).
- [x] Final aggregation reads only cached per-unit files (`load_cached_units` /
  in-SQL over chunk parquets), never raw parquet — validated for all three scopes.

### 1.3 Scope 1 — Per-video (50 random samples)

- [x] Sample 50 video paths (seed 42, recorded to `per_video_sample.json`).
- [x] Per video: load → compute → cache → plot (50 PNGs in `per_video/plots/`).
- [x] Output: `cache/motion_analysis/per_video/summary.parquet` (27,150 rows =
  50 videos × 543 landmarks).

### 1.4 Scope 2 — Per-category (10 sampled sign categories)

- [x] Sample 10 sign labels (seed 42, recorded to `per_category_sample.json`).
- [x] Per category: batched load (100 videos/read) → aggregate RMS speed per
  landmark (mean + std — feeds the future within-class consistency analysis).
- [x] Output: `cache/motion_analysis/per_category/summary.parquet`
  (`sign, type, landmark_index, rms_speed_mean, rms_speed_std, n_videos`).

### 1.5 Scope 3 — Global (entire dataset)

- [x] Decision: full in-SQL aggregation rejected (Savitzky-Golay needs ordered
  per-frame series) → chunked Python compute, then **in-SQL aggregation over the
  cached chunk parquets** (the memory-bounded part still happens in DuckDB).
- [x] 189 chunks of ≤500 videos through load → compute → cache, manifest tracking
  chunk completion — full run ≈25 min at ~65 videos/s, 0 failures.
- [x] Output: `cache/motion_analysis/global/summary.parquet` + `global_overview.png`.

### 1.6 Cross-scope comparison

- [x] Overlay plot + rank correlation: per-video sample rho **0.954**, per-category
  sample rho **0.996** vs global (n=543) — the seeded samples reproduce the global
  per-landmark pattern, so sample-based landmark analyses can be trusted.
- [x] Cross-check against the competition 1st-place landmark subset — done in
  `docs/2026-07-15.md` §5: agrees on hands / face-mass-discard / legs / z-drop;
  diverges on upper-body pose (ME-126 keeps, 1st place drops) and lips (1st
  place keeps, on linguistic grounds motion energy can't see).

### 1.8 Follow-ups from the 2026-07-15 findings (report §7)

- [x] xy-vs-xyz decomposition on the 50-video sample — **~92% of pose "motion" is
  z-axis noise** (pose-head 99%, legs 95%; hands only 24%, face 14%). Cached at
  `cache/motion_analysis/xy_vs_xyz_sample50.parquet`, chart in the report.
- [ ] Re-run the **global** scope with xy-only RMS (store `rms_speed_xy` alongside
  `rms_speed` in the chunk schema) so landmark-importance numbers at full-dataset
  scale aren't z-contaminated.
- [ ] Consider adding the xy/xyz split to `compute_motion_energy` itself (cheap —
  same smoothed array, second reduction) before any re-run.

### 1.7 Explicitly out of scope here

- Within-class / cross-class ANOVA-style discriminability analysis (separate
  future task — this notebook only produces its motion-energy inputs)
- Gradient saliency / SHAP (needs a trained model; this is pre-training analysis)
- Spectrogram-format conversion

---

## 2. Bulk Landmark Extraction (POPSIGN)

**Decision (resolved):** extracted landmarks go to **`data/raw/popsign/{train,test}`**,
rooted at the separate drive configured via `POPSIGN_LANDMARKS_DRIVE` in `.env`
when set (fallback: `src/data/`, gitignored) — too large to live next to the code.

### 2.1 Extraction module — `modules/dataset/landmark/extraction.py` (2026-07-16)

Replaces the deleted `modules/data/landmark_worker.py` (whose known bugs —
landmarks never written to the npz, stale hardcoded model path and output dir —
must not be reproduced):

- [x] Per-video MediaPipe Holistic extraction saving **all** landmark groups
  (face + pose + both hands → one `(T, 543, 3)` float16 npz in GISLR holistic
  row order + fps/num_frames metadata), atomic writes (temp file + `os.replace`).
  Smoke-validated 2026-07-16: 211-frame video → npz with 7% NaN, hand/pose/face
  blocks populated.
- [x] Multiprocess pool **capped at ≤70% of CPU / RAM** (worker count from
  `cpu_count × 0.70`, workers pinned to 1 math thread, RAM backpressure via
  `psutil`); MediaPipe is CPU-only on Windows so GPU is not touched.
  Pool + Windows-spawn path and resume-skip validated on a 4-video run.
- [x] Output layout `data/raw/popsign/{train,test}/<label>/<id>.npz`, root
  resolved via `POPSIGN_LANDMARKS_DRIVE` (fallback `src/data/`, gitignored).

### 2.2 Extraction driver — `src/popsign.0.dataset.extraction.ipynb` (2026-07-16)

Replaces the deleted `popsign.0.dataset.ipynb` stub as the extraction driver
(`popsign.1.mediapipe.ipynb` stays stale pending retirement, §0.1):

- [x] Manifest verification (`data/cache/dataframes/{train,test}.csv`) — both
  verified 2026-07-16 (30,867 train / 33,600 test rows, unique ids, spot-checked
  paths exist; train covers 72 labels = the 1 enabled dataset).
- [x] **Pilot batch (≤100 videos) cells built**: seeded sample, worker-count
  sweep (6/10/14/19) on disjoint 20-video slices under the 70% cap, measured
  videos/s + frames/s + CPU%, ETA + disk projection (`cache/popsign_extraction/`).
- [x] Resumable bulk-extraction cells with progress bars + QC section
  (interruption-safe over ~30K videos) — §1.2 manifest pattern (per-unit artifact
  before `done`, atomic saves, `failed` retried, batched manifest rewrites).
- [x] Pilot output moved to the temp tree (2026-07-18): npz →
  `data/temp/popsign_pilot/w<N>/`, deleted by the notebook's cleanup cell once
  `eta.json` is recorded in `data/cache/popsign/extraction/`.
- [ ] Regenerate the video manifests at `data/cache/popsign/dataframes/`
  (pre-restructure copies cleared — see §0.4), ideally with **all 4** POPSIGN
  train datasets — currently only 1 of 4 is enabled in
  `modules/paths.py::resolve_datasets` (~650GB still to download).
- [ ] Run the pilot (user), review videos/s + resource headroom, then run the
  bulk extraction for train + test.

---

## 3. Data-Driven Landmark Importance

- [x] Motion energy (feeds from §1) — delivered; keep/discard recommendation in
  `docs/2026-07-15.md` §4 (keep: hands 42 + upper-body pose 8 + lips 40 + eyes/
  nose 36 = **ME-126**; discard: 392 face, pose head/legs, z channel).
- [x] Within-class consistency + cross-class discriminability — **delivered
  2026-07-16** (`docs/2026-07-16.md`): per-landmark **ANOVA F-ratio** +
  **mutual information** on per-video descriptors, **probe classifier** as the
  subset score. Verdict: **ME-126 wins** (49.9% global probe; FP-118 48.6%,
  FULL-543 last at 40.6%); pose divergence adjudicated in ME's favor;
  discriminability is ~uncorrelated with motion energy (rho −0.12). Caveat
  discovered: marginal F cannot rank face landmarks either (rigid-head
  redundancy) — the subset-level probe is the instrument that prices it.
- [ ] Position as complementary to gradient saliency and SHAP from trained models
  (not a replacement)

### 3.0 Landmark-subset registry + comparison notebook (2026-07-16)

- [x] `src/modules/dataset/landmark/subsets.py` — canonical registry of every
  landmark subset in play (FULL_543, FP_118 = 1st-place, ME_126, ME_132,
  HANDS_42, HANDS_POSE_50, plus component groups) with holistic row indices —
  `ME_126.array` verified equal to the trained run's `landmarks.npy`.
- [x] `src/gislr.0.dataset.subset-comparison.ipynb` — **executed end-to-end
  2026-07-16** (scope A 10 videos / scope B 10 classes / scope C global 189
  chunks, 0 failures; global descriptors ≈50 min, probes ≈7 min). All 6
  registered subsets scored; `probe_acc_global` written back into
  `subsets.py`; report `docs/2026-07-16.md`.
- [~] Feed the winning subset + per-landmark rankings into the §3.1 training
  ablations (probe predicts: pose helps, pose-wrist points {17-22} don't) —
  top-3 probe subsets queued in the rebuilt `gislr.1.model.gru.ipynb`
  (2026-07-16), awaiting user run.
- [ ] Candidate new subset: **face-anchor reduction** (eyes/nose 36 → ~8 rigid
  anchors) — the face's discriminative signal is one rigid transform; needs a
  trained ablation before admission to the registry (report §4).
- [ ] Note for feature work: `x_std` is the most discriminative descriptor
  (median F 25.1 vs 17.3 for speed) — causal running-std features are
  streamable and worth a §3.1-style ablation.

### 3.1 Landmark-subset training ablations (GRU, all-else-identical)

Controlled runs that change ONLY the input subset vs the full-543 baseline
(historical run `20260713-213000`, val acc 70.59%).

**NOTE (2026-07-18):** all runs below predate the registry reset (§0.4) — their
weights are gone, so "canonical evals pending" can no longer be satisfied for
them. Their train-loop numbers stand as historical references; the ablation grid
should be re-run under regime v2 into the fresh registry before drawing final
subset conclusions (the run-to-run-variance caveat below makes this doubly true):

**2026-07-16:** `src/gislr.1.model.gru.ipynb` overhauled into the subset-ablation
driver: trains the top-3 probe subsets (`ME_126`, `ME_132`, `FP_118`) as
all-else-identical runs (per-subset caches + auto-resume + auto-generated run
docs), with `TRAIN_SUBSETS`/`COORDS` as the only knobs — the xy ablation below
is now a one-line config change. Awaiting user run.

- [x] **ME-126, xyz** — done 2026-07-15 (`src/models/gislr/gru/20260715-190729`):
  **73.73% val vs 70.59% baseline (+3.14) with 50.4% fewer params** (0.95M),
  failing classes 22→9. Leaderboard updated in `src/models/README.md`.
  (A reproducibility re-run is included in the rebuilt notebook's default
  `TRAIN_SUBSETS`; drop it there to save ~25 GPU-min.)
- [~] Exact 1st-place 118 (ME-126 minus the 8 pose landmarks) — isolates whether
  upper-body pose helps a *streaming* model (hand-dropout fallback hypothesis).
  Queued as `FP_118` in the rebuilt `gislr.1` notebook — awaiting user run.
- [~] **ME-132** (`ME_126` + pose wrist points {17-22}) — #2 by probe score;
  tests the probe's prediction that the extra 6 landmarks add nothing. Queued
  in the rebuilt `gislr.1` notebook — awaiting user run.
- [~] **xy only** (drop z) — tests the z-noise finding in-model. Trained
  2026-07-17 for all three subsets (v1 regime, `COORDS="xy"`): train-loop val
  acc **ME_126-xy 74.92 / ME_132-xy 74.95 / FP_118-xy 74.54 — each beats its
  xyz counterpart** (73.73 / 72.47–74.95 / 74.60), consistent with the z-noise
  finding. Canonical evals pending. `scripts/eval_gru.py` xy mode added
  2026-07-17 (reads the checkpoint's `coords` key). **Caveat**: ME_132's two
  same-config xyz runs differ by ~2.5 pts (72.47 vs 74.95) — run-to-run
  variance is on the order of the subset deltas, so ablation conclusions need
  the canonical evals (and ideally repeat runs).
- [ ] ME-126 + lag-1/lag-2 difference features (the 1st-place motion features) —
  note these are causal, so streaming-safe.

### 3.2 GRU training-regime update (batch ↑, epochs 300, early stopping) — implemented 2026-07-17

`src/gislr.1.model.gru.ipynb` now trains under regime **`v2-plateau-300`**
(no run executed yet — awaiting user):

- [x] **Batch size 192 → 512**, lr scaled 3e-4 → 1e-3 (16 GB GPU has ample
  headroom for the ~1M-param models; per-epoch time at 512 untested).
- [x] **Epochs 60 → 300 (cap) with early stopping** on val-accuracy plateau:
  no gain > `es_min_delta=1e-3` for `es_patience=15` epochs (both HYP tunables).
- [x] **Scheduler decision: ReduceLROnPlateau** (factor 0.5, patience 5, on
  val acc) — watches the same plateau signal as the stopper with shorter
  patience, so the LR gets a chance to rescue a plateau before the run ends.
  OneCycleLR dropped (fixed-epoch anneal would be truncated by early stops).
- [x] Comparability: `metadata.json`/`hyp.json`/checkpoints carry
  `training_regime` (`v1-onecycle-60` backfilled for all 8 prior runs;
  `index.csv` has the column). v1 vs v2 runs are not
  hyperparameter-comparable; canonical eval split/metric unchanged.
- [x] Resume-safety: plateau counter + scheduler state persist in the
  checkpoint (`epochs_since_gain`, `finished`); resolve_run_dir resumes only
  unfinished runs (finished = early-stopped or cap reached).
- [ ] Run the v2 regime (user) — start with the best subset — and compare
  against its v1 counterpart on the canonical eval before adopting v2 as the
  default family.

## 4. Architecture Benchmarking

GISLR architecture-benchmark notebooks (filed 2026-07-17): one flat notebook
per architecture (`gislr.1.model.<arch>.ipynb`), reusing the `gislr.1.model.gru.ipynb`
pattern — per-subset feature caches, canonical split, auto-resume, one
timestamped run folder per training start, auto-generated
`data.md`/`README.md`/`metadata.json` so every run lands in `src/models/index.csv`.
Train on the best-known subset for comparability with the GRU runs.

- [~] **`gislr.1.model.lstm.ipynb`** — unidirectional `StreamingLSTM`
  (streaming-viable, direct cell-vs-cell GRU comparison; 1.24M params at
  hidden 256×2). **Built 2026-07-17** — awaiting user run.
- [~] **`gislr.1.model.bilstm.ipynb`** — `BiLSTM`, offline-only **accuracy
  reference, never a deployment candidate** (prices the causality gap;
  fwd-last + bwd-first readout, 3.0M params). **Built 2026-07-17** (replaced
  the empty stub) — awaiting user run.
- [~] **`gislr.1.model.cnn1d.ipynb`** — `CausalConv1D`: 5 dilated causal
  Conv1d blocks (kernel 5, dilations 1..16, per-frame LayerNorm, 125-frame
  receptive field ≈ MAX_SEQ_LEN; 1.86M params). Streaming-viable; first step
  toward the 1st-place port. **Built 2026-07-17** — awaiting user run.

All three verified 2026-07-17 by CPU smoke test: forward shapes correct,
future-frame corruption provably doesn't change logits for the two causal
models, and notebook state_dicts load into `scripts/eval_gru.py`'s classes
with identical logits (the script now dispatches on the checkpoint's `arch`
key and handles xy/xyz via its `coords` key).
- [ ] ST-GCN, TCN, Transformer, Conformer — evaluate against the recurrent baselines
- [ ] Caution: 1st-place GISLR Kaggle solution found hand-crafted angle/distance
  features didn't help and GCNs underperformed simpler sequence models — keep this
  in mind when scoping the ST-GCN evaluation

## 5. Spectrogram-Format Checkpoint (CNN/ViT arm)

- [ ] xyz-as-RGB channels, landmarks on y-axis, frames on x-axis
- [ ] Linear interpolation to fixed frame count
- [ ] Scoped only to this benchmarking arm — image quantization deferred to
  spectrogram-build time, not baked into the shared checkpoint format

## Backlog / Someday

- [ ] (add unscoped ideas here as they come up, promote to a numbered section once
  they have a concrete plan)
